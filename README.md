# obsidian-insert-time-plugin
A simple Obsidian plugin that inserts the current time in hh:mm format.

# Redundancy
I have a function written for the exact same thing in Emacs. I just started using Obsidian and immediately thought this is what I need.

I wrote a plugin. This is my first ever Obsidian plugin. But alas, it is not necessary. As I started testing the command, I noticed that some other command from templates was showing up doing the exact same thing. Yeah, try it out. Do `cmd+p`, type `insert current time`. That's it.

The plugin dev took mere 10min. First I got ChatGPT to write it. It wrote wrong stuff, but allowed me to bypass having to read getting started docs carefully. Since GPT's code did not work (at all, to be honest) I checked some docs and figured out what's to be done fairly easily. Good going Obsidian plugins! I have probably messed it up. I see that other plugins have *much* more structure in terms of dirs etc. But hey, I am new to js world. At least it works and is *really* simple.
